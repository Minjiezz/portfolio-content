		<p>Hello, this is a record of my learning photography website. I'm a designer and
		 I really want to document what I see in my life. So I started learning photography
		 on my own about a year ago. I sm still on my way.</p>

		<!-- Make sure your anchor tags have a link (href) and a clickable component -->
		<p>To document my learning process, I will upload my most satisfied photos from
			 each shoot to the site. My favorite subjects are landscapes and animals. 
			 Because I like travelling and seeing different animals. Hope you enjoy it!</p>
